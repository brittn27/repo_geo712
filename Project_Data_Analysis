Project Data Analysis – October 4, 2023

GEO 712 Reproducible Workflow: Assignment

Data:
-	Collect research data from participants via SONA
-	These datasets will be collected individually and appended in a large ‘Master’ spreadsheet

Legal & Ethics:
-	Ethical approve was received from the McMaster Research Ethics Board (MREB)
-	No legal restrictions at this present moment (Oct 4, 2023)

Quick Hit Notes:
-	Raw data file will be each individual raw participant data files that are kept aside from the Master spreadsheet
-	Data files per participant will be exported in .csv format – Master will be in .xlsx
-	File names will look as follows:
o	Data: 01_Data.csv
	Master: 00_MasterData.xlsx
o	Writing: v00_ManuscriptX.docx
-	Standards:
o	Data collection must follow typical spatial cueing procedures used in the SunLab
o	Procedures for the experiments will vary across experiments but will be explicit in a ‘Trial Experimenter Sheet’ for each experimenter to use as a reference while collecting data from each participant
o	Output data files are to be stored in the appropriate ‘Data’ folder under the associated project, as well are to be emailed to Noah (brittn@mcmaster.ca )
