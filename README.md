# Research Interest

My PhD research emphasizes on the study of visual-spatial attention appears distributed across **3D space**. This remains a large gap in the literature as most psychophysical experiments have focused predominantly in 2D space and how attention appears allocated strictly across the x- and y-axesâ€”thereby neglecting the **z-axis**. My projects have attacked in this issue in _virtual space_ using VR technology.
